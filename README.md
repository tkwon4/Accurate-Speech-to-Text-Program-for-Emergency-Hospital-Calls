# Hospital-Whisper
Undergraduate senior year honors thesis on the viability of automated speech to text on emergency hospital recordings.  
The dataset used domain randomization to mimic the radio static of the hospital recordings. This was a solution to both the lack of transcriptions for hospital data(only around 100 used in the validation set) and patient information privacy.  
The results show around a 10% decrease in word error rate when compared to the base whisper-v3-large model used at the start of training.
